# Project Development History

This document chronicles all the issues encountered and fixes implemented during the development of the CloudBees Agentic Workflow Demo.

## Major Issues and Fixes

### 1. Environment Setup Issues

**Issue**: PowerShell command syntax errors when checking environment variables
- **Error**: `$env:OPENAI_API_KEY` syntax not working properly
- **Fix**: Corrected PowerShell command syntax for environment variable checking

**Issue**: Attempting to write directly to `.env` file was blocked by `globalIgnore`
- **Error**: Direct file write operations blocked
- **Fix**: Created `env_template.txt` with instructions for manual `.env` file creation

**Issue**: OpenAI API key not found because `.env` file was named `touch.env`
- **Error**: `ValueError: OPENAI_API_KEY is required`
- **Fix**: Updated `config.py` to provide clear error messages and warnings about correct `.env` file naming

### 2. Dependency Management Issues

**Issue**: Pydantic version incompatibility causing validation errors
- **Error**: `NameError: Fields must not use names with leading underscores`
- **Fix**: Updated `requirements.txt` to use `pydantic==1.10.12` and `pydantic-core==0.18.1`

**Issue**: LangChain import deprecation warnings
- **Error**: `LangChainDeprecationWarning: Importing chat models from langchain is deprecated`
- **Fix**: Updated imports to use `langchain-community` and `langchain-openai`

### 3. Pydantic Validation Errors

**Issue**: `ValueError: "GitHubTool" object has no field "agent"`
- **Error**: BaseTool subclasses couldn't assign attributes not defined as Fields
- **Fix**: Added `_agent: GitHubAgent = Field(default=None)` to all BaseTool subclasses

**Issue**: Similar validation errors for `DocumentationTool` and `ReasoningTool`
- **Error**: Missing field definitions for agent attributes
- **Fix**: Added proper Field definitions for all agent attributes

### 4. LangChain Prompt Template Issues

**Issue**: `ValueError: Prompt missing required variables: {'agent_scratchpad'}`
- **Error**: Missing required variable in ChatPromptTemplate
- **Fix**: Added `MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="agent_scratchpad")` to prompt template

**Issue**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'MessagesPlaceholder' from 'langchain.schema'`
- **Error**: Incorrect import path for MessagesPlaceholder
- **Fix**: Corrected import to `from langchain.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder`

### 5. Agent Orchestration Issues

**Issue**: GitHub agent returning generic queries instead of specific repository analysis
- **Error**: Agent not consistently routing specific queries to tools
- **Fix**: Created simplified demo flow that directly calls tools instead of relying on LLM agent routing

**Issue**: Reasoning agent output showing raw LangChain message objects
- **Error**: Output contained `messages=[SystemMessage(content='...')]` instead of clean text
- **Fix**: Modified `analyze_data` and `reason_about_decision` methods to extract content using `response.content if hasattr(response, 'content') else str(response)`

### 6. GitHub API Accuracy Issues

**Issue**: Incorrect issue counting (counting pull requests as issues)
- **Error**: `/issues` endpoint included both issues and pull requests
- **Fix**: Implemented filtering to exclude pull requests from issue counts

**Issue**: Inaccurate total issue counts from repository info endpoint
- **Error**: `total_issues` from `get_repository_info` not matching actual open/closed counts
- **Fix**: Switched to GitHub Search API (`/search/issues`) for accurate open/closed issue counts

### 7. Output Formatting Issues

**Issue**: Emojis present in terminal output making it unprofessional
- **Error**: Output contained various emojis throughout
- **Fix**: Systematically removed all emojis from `demo.py`, `main.py`, and `basic_demo.py`

**Issue**: README content analysis showing meaningless technical details
- **Error**: Output showed "Total Sections Found: 36" instead of meaningful content
- **Fix**: Improved README content extraction to parse Markdown and extract meaningful lines (description, installation, usage)

**Issue**: AI analysis too generic and using cautious language
- **Error**: Analysis contained "it appears to be", "looks like", "suggests" instead of confident statements
- **Fix**: Updated `analysis_prompt` to encourage specific, confident, and detailed analysis

### 8. User Experience Issues

**Issue**: Awkward step numbering when documentation URL was skipped
- **Error**: Terminal showed "Step 1" then "Step 3" when skipping Step 2
- **Fix**: Implemented dynamic step numbering based on what's actually executed

**Issue**: Major/Critical Issues section showing generic statements instead of specific issues
- **Error**: Section showed generic "High Issue Count" instead of actual important issues
- **Fix**: Enhanced logic to analyze recent issues for keywords and categorize them (Bug, Security, Performance, etc.)

**Issue**: Key Information section showing HTML artifacts and broken markdown
- **Error**: Output contained `<img src=...>` and `**Meta AI Research, GenAI**; **University of Oxford, VGG**`
- **Fix**: Added intelligent filtering to remove HTML tags, broken markdown, and author lists

### 9. GitHub Integration Issues

**Issue**: GitHub push protection blocked push due to OpenAI API key in `.env`
- **Error**: Push rejected due to sensitive information detection
- **Fix**: Used `git rm --cached .env` to remove from tracking and created `.gitignore` to prevent future commits

**Issue**: Invalid repository name or documentation URL validation
- **Error**: Users could input invalid formats like `facebookresearch/co-tracker/pulls`
- **Fix**: Added input validation for repository names (`owner/repo` format) and URLs (`http://` or `https://`)

### 10. Content Quality Issues

**Issue**: AI analysis fallback was hardcoded to specific repository (CoTracker)
- **Error**: Analysis always mentioned CoTracker regardless of input repository
- **Fix**: Made fallback analysis dynamic and repository-specific

**Issue**: Truncated output in AI analysis
- **Error**: Analysis was cut off with "..." truncation
- **Fix**: Removed truncation to show complete analysis

**Issue**: Duplicate "Major/Critical Issues" section appearing at end
- **Error**: Section appeared twice in different contexts
- **Fix**: Renamed duplicate section to "Technical Challenges" for appropriate context
