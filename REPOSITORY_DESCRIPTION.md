# Repository Description for GitHub

## Short Description (for GitHub repo description field):
**Multi-agent autonomous workflow system using LangChain for GitHub repository analysis, documentation processing, and AI-powered reasoning**

## Detailed Description:

### 🌟 Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive demonstration of agentic workflows built for the CloudBees take-home assessment. The system showcases autonomous multi-agent collaboration using LangChain framework, demonstrating how AI agents can work together to analyze GitHub repositories, process documentation, and make reasoned decisions.

### 🚀 Key Features
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Three specialized agents (GitHub, Documentation, Reasoning) working autonomously
- **Accurate Data Analysis**: Uses GitHub Search API for precise issue counting (separates issues from pull requests)
- **Intelligent Documentation Processing**: Fetches and analyzes README content and external documentation
- **AI-Powered Reasoning**: LLM-driven analysis with actionable insights and recommendations
- **Clean Output Formatting**: Professional, readable results with comprehensive error handling
- **Interactive Workflow**: User-friendly interface for repository analysis

### 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **LangChain**: Framework for building agentic workflows
- **OpenAI GPT**: Large language model for reasoning and analysis
- **Python**: Core implementation with async/await patterns
- **GitHub API**: Repository data and issue tracking
- **Web Scraping**: Documentation retrieval and processing

### 🎯 Use Cases
- Repository health analysis and monitoring
- Documentation quality assessment
- Community engagement insights
- Technical decision support
- Automated project evaluation

### 📊 Demo Capabilities
- Analyze any GitHub repository with accurate metrics
- Automatically fetch and process README content
- Optionally analyze additional documentation sources
- Generate AI-powered insights and recommendations
- Provide clean, professional analysis reports

### 🏗️ Architecture
The system implements a sophisticated multi-agent architecture where:
- **GitHub Agent**: Handles repository data, issue tracking, and search functionality
- **Documentation Agent**: Processes web content, extracts key information, and structures data
- **Reasoning Agent**: Applies logical analysis, validates data, and generates insights
- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates agent interactions and manages workflow execution

### 🔧 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up environment variables (OpenAI API key)
4. Run the demo: `python demo.py`
