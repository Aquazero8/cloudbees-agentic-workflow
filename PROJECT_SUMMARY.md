# CloudBees Agentic Workflow Demo - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates **autonomous multi-agent workflows** using LangChain, showcasing how AI agents can collaborate to analyze GitHub repositories, retrieve documentation, and make reasoned decisions. It was built as a take-home assessment for CloudBees, focusing on creativity, clarity, and practical demonstration of agentic reasoning.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Multi-Agent System
The system implements a **team of agents** that work autonomously:

1. **GitHub Agent** (`agents/github_agent.py`)
   - Analyzes GitHub repositories
   - Fetches repository metadata, issues, and statistics
   - Searches for repositories based on criteria
   - Validates data quality and identifies anomalies

2. **Documentation Agent** (`agents/documentation_agent.py`)
   - Retrieves documentation from URLs
   - Parses HTML and Markdown content
   - Extracts structured information (installation steps, usage examples, API references)
   - Analyzes documentation quality and completeness

3. **Reasoning Agent** (`agents/reasoning_agent.py`)
   - Validates data accuracy and completeness
   - Applies logical reasoning to decision points
   - Generates confidence scores and risk assessments
   - Provides actionable recommendations

4. **Main Orchestrator** (`main.py`)
   - Coordinates multi-agent workflows
   - Handles error recovery and fallbacks
   - Demonstrates autonomous decision making
   - Provides high-level workflow interfaces

## 🚀 Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. **Autonomy**
- Agents work independently with specialized capabilities
- Each agent can reason about its actions and validate findings
- Orchestrator coordinates without micromanaging individual agents

### 2. **Reliability**
- Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Data validation and quality checks
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### 3. **Safety**
- Input validation and sanitization
- API rate limiting and proper authentication
- Confidence scoring for all analyses and recommendations

### 4. **Tool Usage**
- GitHub API integration for repository analysis
- Web scraping for documentation retrieval
- LangChain tools for agent coordination
- OpenAI API for reasoning and analysis

## 📋 Workflow Examples

### 1. Repository Analysis Workflow
```python
# Complete analysis of a repository and its documentation
result = await orchestrator.analyze_repository_workflow(
    repository_name="microsoft/vscode",
    documentation_url="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs"
)
```

### 2. Search and Analysis Workflow
```python
# Search for repositories and compare them
result = await orchestrator.search_and_analyze_workflow(
    search_query="python web framework",
    max_repos=3
)
```

### 3. Autonomous Decision Workflow
```python
# Make autonomous decisions based on context
result = await orchestrator.autonomous_decision_workflow(
    context="Team choosing between React, Vue.js, and Svelte",
    decision_point="Which framework should they choose?"
)
```

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
