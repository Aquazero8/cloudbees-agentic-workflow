# Reflection: Coding Assistant Experience

The coding assistant (Cursor) was extremely helpful for rapid prototyping and LangChain integration, generating clean boilerplate code and suggesting proper async patterns that saved significant development time. However, it struggled with complex business logic - the reasoning agent's validation rules needed substantial manual refinement, and it initially suggested overly complex architectures like a plugin system when simpler solutions sufficed.

The assistant excelled at API integration (GitHub API, async HTTP with aiohttp) and code quality standards, but required human oversight for domain-specific requirements and edge case handling. I encountered several issues it helped resolve: Pydantic validation errors, LangChain prompt template problems, and GitHub API rate limiting, though some fixes required multiple iterations.

There were times when the AI would hallucinate and loop while trying to solve an issue. In those cases, I would review the files where the problem occurred, attempt to fix it myself, and then bounce ideas off the assistant when I was unsure, which helped guide it in the right direction.

The assistant was most valuable for initial project setup and standard patterns, but least useful for autonomous decision-making logic and testing strategies. While it generated some incorrect suggestions (hardcoding API keys, missing error handling), these were easily caught and corrected.


Overall, the coding assistant accelerated development by ~60-70% while maintaining code quality, but human expertise remained crucial for architectural decisions and ensuring the solution met specific requirements.
